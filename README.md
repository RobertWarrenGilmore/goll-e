# GOLL-E
The Graph Object Language and Layout Editor is a javascript graph visualization and layout tool. The graph is generated by parsing graph content data (using the GOLL-E Content Language specifications) that is input through a file and laying out the graph contents using a layout algorithm. The graph is then rendered and visualized and the user is able to modify the layout. by dragging the graph elements around. The user will also be able to edit the graph content while using the visualizer by using the in-line editor. The system consists of three core parts:

* The GOLL-E Content Language
* The Visualizer
* The Editor

## GOLL-E Content Language
The GOLL-E Content Language specifies the content of the graph, and any data pertaining the graph. That is the list of vertices contained in the graph, with each vertex detailing the data specific to itself, and a list of edges, with each edge detailing the data specific to itself. The content language is specified in greater detail [here](https://github.com/twosigma/goll-e/wiki/content-language-description).

## The Visualizer
The visualizer plays a key role in this system because it has to support user modification (i.e. dragging vertices to modify the layout).

## The Editor
The final key component of the GOLL-E system is the in-line editor. It allows the user to edit the graph content while looking at the visualized graph.
